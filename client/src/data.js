        "response": "Today our class teacher took us to a zoo. I was quite excited about the trip because I love animals. However, it turned out to be one of the saddest experiences of my life. We saw many birds and animals in the zoo. Alas! They didn’t look happy in their cages. There were colorful parrots and lovebirds. They looked sad in their small enclosures. I am sure they miss the blue skies. The plight of the lion, tiger and leopard was not much better either. They were kept inside tiny cages. They are well-fed and they also receive medical attention whenever they show signs of illness. Yet, they looked tired and unhealthy. I guess that is a result of their sedentary life. They get absolutely no opportunities to walk or run. They pace their small cages up and down looking restive and angry.I am not saying that zoos are bad. They do protect many endangered species. Still it hurts me to see wild animals caged for our entertainment. I know I can’t do anything for them but I can’t help feeling bad for them. I don’t think I will visit a zoo again."

        "response": "What an eventful day was today! I rescued a little girl from drowning in the river. I still can’t believe that I did it. How could I do this? Where did it I get the courage from? I don’t know. I was going to the temple when I heard a child yelling for help from the riverbank. I rushed there and saw a boy shouting for help. His sister had fallen into the river and he couldn’t swim. Neither could she. I saw her flapping with her arms. I also cried for help hoping that someone would come but when I saw nobody anywhere near the river I gathered the courage and jumped into the water. By then, the girl was beginning to sink. I swam with all my strength and managed to get hold of her hair. While it is true that I can swim holding her head above water while swimming back to the shore was quite a challenge for me. Luckily, by the time we reached the shore people had gathered and someone gave her emergency medical aid and rushed her to hospital. Everyone praised me for saving the life of a child putting my own life at risk. I felt both happy and proud."
